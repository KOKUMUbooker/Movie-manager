# **🎬 GroupWatch - Movie Night Coordinator**

**Stop debating, start watching.**

## ** The Problem**

Planning movie nights with friends is frustrating:
- **Endless group chats** debating what to watch
- **Scheduling conflicts** across time zones and busy lives
- **Streaming service fragmentation** - "Who has what?"

4. **Watch & Discuss** - Mark when you watch, rate together, continue the conversation
